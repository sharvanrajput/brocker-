                        <p class="mb-2">At BlazeMoneyFX, Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are an essential part of

                            to maintaining a secure and compliant trading environment. These policies are in place to
                            help prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and the financing of
                            terrorist activities.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3">Our Commitment to Prevention</h4>

                            when funding your account.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3">Required Documents for Verification</h4>

                            required documents as early as possible. BlazeMoneyFX requires receipt and verification of

                        <p class="mb-2">In some cases, document verification may be required before deposits or trading
                            activities
                            are permitted.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Important:</strong> If required documents are not received in time, any
                            pending
                            withdrawals will be canceled and funds will be returned to your BlazeMoneyFX trading
                            account. We will notify you of such actions via our system.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3">Security of Your Documents</h4>

                            verification process.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">We sincerely appreciate your cooperation in helping us make BlazeMoneyFX a
                            trusted and secure
