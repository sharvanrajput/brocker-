                        <p class="mb-2">At BlazeMoneyFX, we strive to ensure our clients receive high-quality financial
                            services.
                            However, in certain exceptional cases, refunds may be issued when deemed necessary. Refunds
                            are only considered if the client provides a valid justification and meets the conditions
                            outlined below.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3">Eligibility for Refunds</h4>
                        <p class="mb-2">Clients may request a refund in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ol class="mb-3">
                            <li>The service was not provided as promised.</li>
                            <li>The service received was not functioning as described.</li>
                            <li>The account was funded, but no trading activity occurred.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="mb-2">Refunds are only processed back to the original credit/debit card used for the
                            initial
                            deposit.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3">How to Request a Refund</h4>
                        <p class="mb-2">To begin the refund process, clients must submit a <strong>cancellation
                                request</strong> via
